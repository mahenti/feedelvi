# Public Folder

Place your static assets here (images, fonts, etc.) and they will be served at the root path.

## Usage

1. Add your images to this folder (e.g., `public/cow-feed.jpg`)
2. Reference them in your code with absolute paths:
   ```tsx
   <img src="/cow-feed.jpg" alt="Cow Feed" />
   ```
